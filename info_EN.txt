The -UEF- clan was founded in December 2006 by 5 active Battlefield 2 players and server owners. Today, we no longer host Battlefield 2 servers, but we have broadened our playing field to include Battlefield 2, 3 & 4, World of Tanks, and Clash of Clans. On November 18, 2014, we started a Clash of Clans clan and decided to only post information about Clash of Clans on this website.

We take pride in our teamwork, loyalty, and being respectful to other players. The -UEF- clan is always looking for new members, provided they adhere to the rules that apply within our clan. We love to share tactics and tricks with other (new) members so that they too can improve their gameplay.

We are a respectful clan, and you can expect the same in return. Always follow the instructions of the clan staff. We want to keep things enjoyable and will do everything we can to maintain that atmosphere. This may mean that we will remove someone from the clan without warning if we believe they are not adhering to the clan's philosophy.

Greetz,

The -UEF- Clan Staff
